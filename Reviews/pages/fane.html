                                world I knew all but obliterated. I must even hide my true face beneath an ever-shifting

                                trying to uncover the truth about a history you primitive people never even knew
                                existed."

                        <p> One of the eternals who lived upon in Rivellon before the seven races came to be, Fane
                            considered The Academy of the Seven his home. With his assistance the Seven Gods seized
                            control of the realm and cast the others into the void; he himself was also sealed away by
                            other means along with his child, who later took the form of Dallis.

                        </p>

                        <p> He is first encountered on the Merryweather under the guise of an elf, however when Windego
                            breaks free of her Source collar and unleashes the voidwoken on the ship she steals his
                            mask, rendering his skeletal form visible to others. </p>

                        <p>Upon landing on Reapers' Eye, he investigates the corpses of those who have recently died
                            within Hidden Alcove north of Fort Joy, looking to see if there is a way to detach the face
                            from the body and craft a new mask; however it is not until he meets Kniles, a surgeon with
                            a twisted taste for torture that he discovers a device known as a face ripper which can
                            cleanly remove a face from a body.[2] With this device and Source orbs Fane is finally able
                            to craft masks to disguise this undead form, however as he travels out to the Hollow
                            Marshes, he may come face to face with Windego and defeat her for his mask.

                        </p>

                        <p> As Fane makes his escape from the island, he is approached by Amadia to be her godwoken
                            champion and for the second time, assists the Seven Gods into defeating the eternal race,
                            who have now become voidwoken.

                        <p> His first opportunity to strike the Bishop down is given at the north eastern dock on
                            Reaper's
                            Eye; attempting to escape the island with the seekers, Alexandar is awaiting at the dock
                            with
                            several Magisters. Although his target was rendered unconscious, Ifan was unable to complete
                            the
                            contract; interrupted firstly by a voidwoken deep-dweller in the midst of battle and finally
                            Malady after the battle was over. Alexandar, taken captive, was secured on the Lady
                            Vengeance,
                            under Ifan's watchful eye. Unfortunately for Ifan, Alexandar was able to escape during
                            Dallis'
                            and Vredeman's assault on the ship, delaying the Lone Wolf's mission.</p>

                        <p> Continuing on his quest to become the Divine One, Ifan reaches Driftwood, a town on Reaper's
                            Coast, encountering Meistr Siva, Ifan expands his ability to wield Source, travelling north
                            westerly, Ifan encounters the lizard, Hannag, the creator of the deathfog bomb at Lucian's
                            behest. Furthermore from the lizard he learned that the teleportation device he believed he
                            was
                            carrying was in fact a the bomb itself. Upon learning this fact, his anger refocused on his
                            former leader, seeking revenge and redemption for this betrayal. Continuing onward to
                            Nameless
                            Isle, Ifan comes face to face with Alexandar, who confirmed that he too was aware of the
                            plan,
                            rationalising it as the only way to win the war and losing was not a viable option.</p>

                        <p> Eventually reaching Arx, Ifan descends into Lucian's crypt, discovering his former leader to
                            still be alive. Confronting him, Ifan demands that he pay for the elven sacrifice.
                            Attempting to
                            reason with him, Lucian tells him that the using the bomb was a mistake, that all the
                            sacrifices
                            must have meaning and the void must be stopped. Even though he betrayed his subordinate,
                            Lucian
                            still sees him as a friend. Forgiving Lucian he gave up his source and after being restored
                            by
                            Malady, left into seclusion and helped the elves to regrow their forest.</p>

                        <p> By 1244 AD Ifan rejoins the Order. With the Commander and Lohse, they embark on a mission to
                            capture Malady ,who stole magical weapons from Lucian.</p>
