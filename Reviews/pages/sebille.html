                        <p> An elf who was enslaved to the Shadow Master, via the power of a living scar on her face.
                            Sebille managed to break free his control and intentionally sought her way to Fort Joy to
                            find Stingtail, who marked her so in the first place. On her arms are the names of all these
                            she has killed, many of them (unbeknownst to her) scions of various tribes.</p>

                        <p> As she embarks on her journey as a Godwoken at Reaper's Coast to seek Divinity and revenge
                            on her former master, she discovers from Saheila, another scion, that she is the Prime
                            Scion; one who will replace the Mother Tree. Her journey to the Nameless Isle intertwines
                            her two objectives, when meeting with the Mother Tree, it is discovered that it is in fact,
                            sick and dying, with the only means of curing of it of its ails is the heart of the Shadow
                            Master.</p>

                        <p>Saheila will meet with Sebille again and advise her that the future she sees requires the
                            death of the Mother Tree and for Sebille to take its place. As Sebille draws near to the
                            Shadow Master, he is singing her song, one that will again ensnare her in his control. Her
                            only means of ensuring her permanent freedom is to take his life.</p>

                    <span class="p-block">

                        <p> His first opportunity to strike the Bishop down is given at the north eastern dock on
                            Reaper's
                            Eye; attempting to escape the island with the seekers, Alexandar is awaiting at the dock
                            with
                            several Magisters. Although his target was rendered unconscious, Ifan was unable to complete
                            the
                            contract; interrupted firstly by a voidwoken deep-dweller in the midst of battle and finally
                            Malady after the battle was over. Alexandar, taken captive, was secured on the Lady
                            Vengeance,
                            under Ifan's watchful eye. Unfortunately for Ifan, Alexandar was able to escape during
                            Dallis'
                            and Vredeman's assault on the ship, delaying the Lone Wolf's mission.</p>

                        <p> Continuing on his quest to become the Divine One, Ifan reaches Driftwood, a town on Reaper's
                            Coast, encountering Meistr Siva, Ifan expands his ability to wield Source, travelling north
                            westerly, Ifan encounters the lizard, Hannag, the creator of the deathfog bomb at Lucian's
                            behest. Furthermore from the lizard he learned that the teleportation device he believed he
                            was
                            carrying was in fact a the bomb itself. Upon learning this fact, his anger refocused on his
                            former leader, seeking revenge and redemption for this betrayal. Continuing onward to
                            Nameless
                            Isle, Ifan comes face to face with Alexandar, who confirmed that he too was aware of the
                            plan,
                            rationalising it as the only way to win the war and losing was not a viable option.</p>

                        <p> Eventually reaching Arx, Ifan descends into Lucian's crypt, discovering his former leader to
                            still be alive. Confronting him, Ifan demands that he pay for the elven sacrifice.
                            Attempting to
                            reason with him, Lucian tells him that the using the bomb was a mistake, that all the
                            sacrifices
                            must have meaning and the void must be stopped. Even though he betrayed his subordinate,
                            Lucian
                            still sees him as a friend. Forgiving Lucian he gave up his source and after being restored
                            by
                            Malady, left into seclusion and helped the elves to regrow their forest.</p>

                        <p> By 1244 AD Ifan rejoins the Order. With the Commander and Lohse, they embark on a mission to
                            capture Malady ,who stole magical weapons from Lucian.</p>
