                        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-right">- Ifan, ready to do battle against the Divine
                            Order</figcaption>
                    </figure>


                    <span class="lead" id="p1">
                        <p> As a child, Ifan lived and travelled with his parents who were spice traders until a
                            band of
                            bandits killed them. Adopted by a nearby elven tribe after his parents murder, he lived with
                            them until he became an adult, learning their language and customs.[1]</p>

                        <p> Leaving the elves as an adult, he joined the Divine Order and quickly gained an attention
                            and
                            favour of Lucian the Divine himself and they became friends; however, he had a constant
                            distrust
                            of the Divine's son, Alexandar whispering in his father ear. In 1233 AD Lucian sent Ifan
                            with a
                            rift scroll to evacuate the elves from the area before a deathfog bomb was released in their
                            lands to prevent the encroachment of the Black Ring. Making his way to the elven lands, the
                            Ring
                            attacked Ifan, slowing his journey, but ultimately reaching his destination, the elves
                            eliminate
                            his remaining pursuers.</p>

                        <p>Initially met with suspicion by the elves, Ifan requests an audience with their Scions to
                            discuss the evacuation. His elven connections earn him the trust of the community, but they
                            suspect the intentions of his leader. however, accepting his word and agreeing to evacuate.
                            Taking the rift scroll to check the incantation before arranging the evacuation, deathfog
                            pours
                            forth from the scroll, flooding the forest. Close to death, Ifan's wolf is summoned forth
                            and
                            extracts Ifan before he succumbed to its effects. In anger at the destruction of the elves
                            he
                            forsook the Divine Order and Lucian, preferring to "join the Black Ring over wearing the
                            mark of
                            the Divine Order again".[2]</p>

                        <p> After Lucians death he joined the Lone Wolves and spent most of his time hunting his targets
                            and
                            drinking in the Undertavern in Driftwood. One day when having a good time with a drudanae he
                            thinks he is attacked by a tiger and uses his source to summon a wolf into the tavern. This
                            resulted in his capture by magisters and put aboard the Merryweather, a Magister ship for
                            carrying sourcerers, sailing to Fort Joy on Reapers' Eye. In unbeknownst to his captors,
                            this
                            would prime him for his next assignment: to assassinate the leader of the Divine Order,
                            Bishop
                            Alexandar.[3] In addition to his contract, Ifan is made aware that he has been chosen for a
                            greater mission: Rhalic, presenting himself to the Lone Wolf explains that he has been
                            chosen as
                            the Godwoken for the human race and must ascend to the position on the Divine One to prevent
                            the
                            voidwoken from consuming the planet.</p>

                    <span id="p2">
                        <p> His first opportunity to strike the Bishop down is given at the north eastern dock on
                            Reaper's
                            Eye; attempting to escape the island with the seekers, Alexandar is awaiting at the dock
                            with
                            several Magisters. Although his target was rendered unconscious, Ifan was unable to complete
                            the
                            contract; interrupted firstly by a voidwoken deep-dweller in the midst of battle and finally
                            Malady after the battle was over. Alexandar, taken captive, was secured on the Lady
                            Vengeance,
                            under Ifan's watchful eye. Unfortunately for Ifan, Alexandar was able to escape during
                            Dallis'
                            and Vredeman's assault on the ship, delaying the Lone Wolf's mission.</p>

                        <p> Continuing on his quest to become the Divine One, Ifan reaches Driftwood, a town on Reaper's
                            Coast, encountering Meistr Siva, Ifan expands his ability to wield Source, travelling north
                            westerly, Ifan encounters the lizard, Hannag, the creator of the deathfog bomb at Lucian's
                            behest. Furthermore from the lizard he learned that the teleportation device he believed he
                            was
                            carrying was in fact a the bomb itself. Upon learning this fact, his anger refocused on his
                            former leader, seeking revenge and redemption for this betrayal. Continuing onward to
                            Nameless
                            Isle, Ifan comes face to face with Alexandar, who confirmed that he too was aware of the
                            plan,
                            rationalising it as the only way to win the war and losing was not a viable option.</p>

                        <p> Eventually reaching Arx, Ifan descends into Lucian's crypt, discovering his former leader to
                            still be alive. Confronting him, Ifan demands that he pay for the elven sacrifice.
                            Attempting to
                            reason with him, Lucian tells him that the using the bomb was a mistake, that all the
                            sacrifices
                            must have meaning and the void must be stopped. Even though he betrayed his subordinate,
                            Lucian
                            still sees him as a friend. Forgiving Lucian he gave up his source and after being restored
                            by
                            Malady, left into seclusion and helped the elves to regrow their forest.</p>

                        <p> By 1244 AD Ifan rejoins the Order. With the Commander and Lohse, they embark on a mission to
                            capture Malady ,who stole magical weapons from Lucian.</p>
